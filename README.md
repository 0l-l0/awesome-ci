## List of Continuous Integration services

### Intro
There are a lot of cloud
[continuous integration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) services.
All of them have different set of functionality,
some of them require payment, some of them are free.
I have created [a list of such services](/continuous-integration-services-list.md) to make easy comparison
of them and choose more suitable for you.

Some of CI services has open source code thus you can setup them in standalone mode.
Pay attention in column "Features".

[Similar comparison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_continuous_integration_software) is on Wikipedia.
